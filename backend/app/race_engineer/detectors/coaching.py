"""Coaching callouts: repeated lockups/wheelspin and per-corner time loss.

Everything here is spoken after a lap completes, never during the corner —
a warning that arrives mid-apex is a distraction, not coaching.

Every comparison is made on the reference lap's distance axis
(`EngineerContext.on_axis`), and what a lap did at a corner — where it
braked, how slow it got — is `processing.corner_metrics`' answer, the same
one the lap analysis document carries. Nothing here defines a braking point.
